## Food Insecurity in America Proposal

The motivation for this project:

Food insecurity remains a major issue in America with around [38 million
people nationwide on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
in 2019](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Alabama).
This represents about 12% of the total population. We are interested to
look deeper into the issue of food insecurity in America and the use of
SNAP to determine what areas and demographics in the US are the most
affected by food insecurity and what magnitude people suffer from food
insecurity.
