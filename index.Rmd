Food insecurity, a condition in which households lack access to adequate food because of limited money or other resources, is a leading health and nutrition issue in the United States. In 2017 approximately forty million Americans were food insecure.

Food insecurity is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including mental health problems, diabetes, hypertension, asthma and poorer general health. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Americans have lost stable employment; early estimates suggest more than 50 million people, including 17 million children, may be experiencing food insecurity in 2020. 

We were collectively interested in investigating the prevalence of food insecurity on the county-level and its association with select social determinants of health to understand the specific regions and/or subpopulations at the greatest risk for food insecurity. This information will help identify targets for future health policy implementation.
