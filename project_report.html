<h2><em>Food Insecurity Prevalence and Significance</em></h2>
<p>Food insecurity, the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food, is a leading health and nutrition issue in the United States. In 2017 an estimated <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/research/map-the-meal-gap/2016/2016-map-the-meal-gap-health-implications.pdf">40 million Americans</a> (13.2 percent) were food insecure.</p>
<p>Food insecurity is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including mental health problems, diabetes, hypertension, asthma and poorer general health. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Americans have lost stable employment; early estimates suggest more than 50 million people, including 17 million children, may be experiencing food insecurity in 2020.</p>
<p>Existing research has shown food insecurity to disproportionately impact non-White populations, as well as immigrants, those lacking health insurance, and those with lower educational attainment.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1.</em> National food insecurity prevalence by race and ethnicity</p>
<p><img src="FI_prevalence_by_race.png" /><br />
Image from <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/food-insecurity-by-race-and-ethnicity-reveals-stark-disparities">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a></p>
<p>As a result of the increasing prevalence of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are collectively interested in investigating the prevalence of food insecurity on the county-level and its association with select social determinants of health.</p>
<p>This is of particular importance, since <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">research</a> has shown the COVID-19 pandemic to be disproportionately impacting many of these same sub-populations. Moreover, a majority of food insecure individuals surveyed in Feeding America’s 2014 Hunger in America <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger#:~:text=Hunger%20and%20health%20are%20deeply,adverse%20effects%20to%20overall%20health.">study</a> reported having to choose between food and medical care. Increasing financial burden in 2020 due to job and/or health insurance loss may be further exacerbating this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Thus, identifying the specific regions and/or sub-populations at the greatest risk for food insecurity is essential to develop and enact targeted, effective intervention strategies to reduce the burden of food insecurity.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>Initially, our overarching question was, what does the food disparity across the United States look like on national, regional and county-levels? After investigating the variables in our datasets, we developed more specific research questions and goals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which counties, states and regions are most disproportionately affected by food insecurity?</li>
<li>What are the demographic breakdowns of food insecure counties?</li>
<li>How has food insecurity changed overtime in the USA and specifically NY state?</li>
<li>And, can we visualize food insecurity in an accessible way to give people information on how they can help and/or access nutrition assistance resources?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We utilized Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap data to quantify food insecurity on a county and regional level. <a href="./Map%20the%20Meal%20Gap%20Overview%20and%20FAQ%2010.2020.pdf">Map the Meal Gap</a> is an annual study conducted by Feeding America to characterize how food insecurity and food costs vary at the local level. Understanding these variations may allow communities to develop targeted strategies to reach people struggling with hunger. For this project, we used Map the Meal Gap annual study reports from years 2011 to 2019, where each report is based on US Census data from the preceding two years. Thus, the study data range from years 2009 - 2017.</p>
<p>Each report presents estimates of 15 food insecurity indicators generated using predictive modeling. Data were presented on the state, county, and congressional district-level. For this project, we used county-level data. We chose to specifically focus on 8 of those 15 indicators for our analysis.</p>
<p>8 Food Insecurity Indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food Insecurity Rate(the % of food insecure people)</li>
<li>Number of Food Insecure Individuals</li>
<li>Weighted Annual Food Budget Shortfall($)</li>
<li>Cost Per Meal(Average cost per meal in $)</li>
<li>Child Food Insecurity Rate(the % of food insecure children)</li>
<li>Number of Food Insecure Children</li>
<li>% of Children in Food Insecure Households with Household Incomes Below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level</li>
<li>% of Children in Food Insecure Households with Household Incomes Above 185% of the Federal Poverty Level</li>
</ul>
<p>As these data were contained on multiple Excel files, we used the map function to import the data across files. Since column naming was not always consistent across files, the coalesce function was used to combine data from columns representing the same variables. We then generated a unique county-state field, and re-valued select county entries using stringr to be consistent with the US Healthcare.gov Geocodes dataset county naming convention (<a href="https://data.healthcare.gov/resource/geocodes-usa-with-counties.json" class="uri">https://data.healthcare.gov/resource/geocodes-usa-with-counties.json</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the Map the Meal Gap data, we also used <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/geographic-comparison-tables/">2017 US Census American Community Survey (ACS) datasets</a>, which provide county-level breakdowns of relevant social determinants of health, including county racial and ethnic makeup, percent uninsured, percent foreign born, educational attainment breakdowns, and income category breakdowns. We merged these datasets on the county variable to generate a singular tidied table containing county-level food insecurity estimates and demographic breakdowns.</p>
<p>Like the Map the Meal Gap data, the ACS data were contained on multiple CSV files. Thus, we used the map function to import the data across files. To merge this dataset with the Map the Meal Gap data on the county variable, we also re-valued county entries using stringr to be consistent with the above mentioned county naming convention.</p>

<p>To view geographic trends in food insecurity indicators across the United States and over time, we also generated an interactive <a href="https://tessas.shinyapps.io/countymaps/">county map</a> of the US which allows users to view and compare food insecurity measures across all counties simultaneously. Users may select the food insecurity metric of interest, as well as the year and particular states, if desired.</p>
<p>We also created an <a href="https://tessas.shinyapps.io/countymaps/">interactive map</a> which contains the locations of food banks across the United States to encourage utilization and/or donation.</p>
<p>To supplement the above exploratory analyses, we became interested in comparing and characterizing the prevalence of food insecurity within select New York state counties, and US regions. We generated <a href="https://nice8x.github.io/food_insecurity_final/dashboard_2.html">animated boxplots</a> which transition through four food insecurity indicators: overall food insecurity rate, the total number of food insecure individuals, child food insecurity rate and the number of food insecure children.</p>
<p>The below plot shows the overall and child food insecurity rates in select New York state counties of interest (New York, Queens, Kings, Bronx, Westchester, Albany, Saint Lawrence and Chautauqua) over the 9 year period (2009-2017):</p>

<p>To see population-based plots depicting the number of food insecure people and children in each selected New York State county and in each US region, visit our <a href="https://nice8x.github.io/food_insecurity_final/dashboard_2.html">NY and More dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>After observing county, state, and region-level differences in food insecurity rates, we became interested in assessing how food insecurity may have evolved overtime in select areas. The below line graph shows trends in overall food insecurity rate overtime from 2009 - 2017 in the 8 selected New York state counties of interest.</p>

<div id="regional-variation-in-food-insecurity-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Regional variation in food insecurity</h3>
<p>There exists substantial regional variation in food insecurity and child food insecurity rates, and in the number of food insecure children and individuals across the United States. North Dakota, northern Virginia and Maryland contain counties with some of the lowest rates of food insecurity (less than 10 percent). Alabama and Mississippi, on the other hand, contain counties with over 35 percent overall food insecurity rates.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis of the box plot data shows substantial variation in food insecurity between several selected counties within New York state. We selected Kings, Bronx, New York, Queens, Westchester, Albany, Chautauqua and Saint Lawrence counties to compare food insecurity across both rural and urban communities. While the Bronx had the highest rates of overall and child food insecurity, Kings county had the largest number of food insecure individuals and children due to differences in population size. The selected rural counties (Saint Lawrence and Chautauqua) had particularly high child food insecurity rates; higher rates were observed only in Bronx county.</p>
<p>On a state level, Mississippi was shown to have the highest rate of overall food insecurity, while North Dakota had the lowest. Regionally, the South had the highest rates of overall and child food insecurity, as well as the greatest numbers of food insecure individuals and children. The Northeast had the lowest rates of food insecurity and fewest food insecure people.</p>
</div>

<div id="food-insecurity-and-county-demographic-breakdowns-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Food insecurity and county demographic breakdowns</h2>
<p>Observational analysis of the scatterplot data suggests that there is a difference in food insecurity rates between races, levels of educational attainment, income brackets, and insurance statuses.</p>
<p>There appears to be a positive association between percent Black race and food insecurity rate, and a negative association between percent White race and food insecurity rate on the county-level. White individuals populate the majority of virtually all counties, where increasing food insecurity rates are seen among counties in which the percentage of white individuals begins to drop. As the percentage of Black individuals increases within a county to above ~25%, food insecurity rates begin to increase.</p>
<p>While a vast majority of US counties contain marginally small percentages of American Indian and/or Alaskan Native people, there appears to be a positive association between percent Native and food insecurity among the handful of counties with percentages between 15 and 75 percent.</p>
<p>Among the educational attainment categories, there appears to be a negative association between bachelor’s degree attainment and food insecurity rate. Conversely, the scatterplot shows a slight positive trend between 9-12th grade educational level and food insecurity rate. While no formal analysis was conducted, this finding is supported by the increased availability of higher paying jobs for college-educated individuals, and by the fact that college-educated individuals tend to have access to more financial resources than non-college-educated individuals.</p>
<p>The insurance status plots suggest a positive association between percent uninsured people (ages 19-64) and food insecurity rate. Lastly, income brackets do show stark differences in distribution of individuals. As expected, higher proportions of upper quartile earners were associated with reduced county-level food insecurity rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="trends-in-national-food-insecurity-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Trends in national food insecurity rates</h2>
<p>The national food insecurity rate has been slowly decreasing from 2009 to 2017 from about 16.16% to about 13.24%. The average child food insecurity rate has also been decreasing, from about 25.8% to 19.36%. The average rate of child food insecurity in the USA is consistently higher than the overall average rate of food insecurity from year to year.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the number of food insecure individuals in the entire USA has been slowly decreasing from 2009 to 2017 from almost 47 million (46,972,100) to just above than 40 million (40,286,060). The number of food insecure children in the entire USA has also been slowly decreasing from 2009 to 2017 from over 18 million (18,281,540) to less than 14 million (13,268,380).</p>
<p>The average cost per meal decreased from about <code>$2.55</code> to <code>$2.52</code> from 2009 to 2010 but after 2010 has been steadily increasing. In 2017 the average cost per meal was <code>$3.02</code>. The average weighted annual food budget shortfall in the US increased from about 6.3 million (6,325,000) in 2009 to almost 7.5 million(7,498,000) in 2014. Since 2014 the average weighted annual food budget shortfall has decreased to about 6.9 million(6,914,000) in 2017.</p>
